# IDD — Design Rationale and Maintainer Notes

This document collects maintainer-facing rationale, diagnostics, and
narrative justifications that explain _why_ IDD phase rules exist as
they do. The rules themselves stay in
`.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`; this file is the place to
record the context that helps future maintainers evaluate edits to
those rules without bloating the auto-loaded instruction surface.

Each section corresponds to one phase file. Add new rationale entries
under the matching phase heading. Behavior-changing constraints
(fail-closed defaults, claim revalidation, marker authority) must
remain in the instruction files.

## Discover

### A0-O roadmap-first fallback triggers

The `roadmap-first` A0-O fallback originally fired only when **zero
candidates reached A3.5** (trigger (a)) — A2 found no open execution
leaves, or A3 filtered them all out as blocked. But a candidate can reach
A3.5 and still be unworkable: the workshop leaves #553 (which runs a real
external deployment) and #611 (a "published" convergence checkpoint)
pass A3 readiness and A3.5 (the owner self-approves), then fail the A4
viability gate (Autonomous completion). Because they reached A3.5, the
original trigger stayed suppressed, so A4 stopped with "no viable
issue" and never fell back to A0-O even when claimable orphan issues
existed — forcing an operator opt-in every loop. The same shadowing
occurred when A4 Step 1.5 eliminated the last A3.5-startable candidate.

Trigger (b) closes that gap: the fallback also fires when the roadmap
path yields no viable, startable, unclaimed candidate because A4
Step 1 viability discards them all or Step 1.5 eliminates the last.
Three guards keep it safe:

- **Approval hold precedence.** A non-empty A3.5 approval-needed
  bucket is not a true zero; the fallback fires on viability/claim
  exhaustion only, never on the approval hold, so it never re-scopes
  around the approval gate.
- **True zero only.** It fires only when no viable, startable,
  unclaimed roadmap candidate remains — never when A4 discards some
  candidates but keeps others.
- **At most once per pass.** A0-O runs at most once as the
  roadmap-first fallback per Discover pass. Once spent (via trigger
  (a), (b), (c), or (d)), any later A4 Step 1 / Step 1.5 exhaustion —
  reachable after trigger (b) or (d), once either one's own A0-O run
  yields orphan candidates that later fail A4 — reports and stops (not
  an abort) without re-entering A0-O. A **trigger (a)** or **trigger (c)** A0-O
  run that finds no orphan routes to the A3 decision tree (both paths
  genuinely empty); a **trigger (b)** or **trigger (d)** one reports
  and stops instead — (b) because roadmap candidates reached A4, an
  exhaustion the A3 tree's A2/A3-empty cases do not describe; (d)
  because A1.5 already reported its own specific blocker, which the A3
  tree's generic wording would misdescribe or duplicate. This prevents
  an A1 ↔ A0-O or A4 ↔ A0-O loop.

When **trigger (a)** (zero A3.5-reaching candidates) and the orphan
fallback both yield nothing, discovery lands in the A3 decision tree,
exactly as the zero-reach-A3.5 case did before. **Trigger (b)** instead
reports and stops (not an abort): roadmap candidates reached A4, so the
A3 tree's A2/A3-empty reports would misdescribe the exhaustion.
Triggers (a) and (b) are scoped to roadmap traversal (A2→A3→A4) — the
A0-T explicit-target gate keeps its own no-fallback stop.

**Trigger (c)** closes a third gap, one step earlier than (a)/(b):
triggers (a) and (b) both presuppose A1 already found a roadmap to
traverse. When A1 itself finds **zero open roadmap issues** — not "the
roadmap's graph is exhausted" but "no roadmap exists at all" — the
original text still hard-aborted immediately, even though
`roadmap-first`'s whole purpose is to fall back to orphan work when
roadmap work runs dry. This surfaced live on 2026-07-18: roadmap #1445
closed after its last tracked issue (#1501) shipped, leaving zero open
roadmaps; Discover correctly identified A1's documented abort condition
and stopped — a harder stop than (a)/(b) impose for what is, from an
operator's perspective, the same underlying situation (no roadmap work
available right now).

Trigger (c) fires at A1, before A1.5/A2/A3 ever run. Like trigger (a),
an A0-O run it invokes that finds no orphan candidates routes to
the A3 decision tree — the **true zero** and **at most once** guards
above apply unchanged. The **approval hold precedence** guard doesn't apply
to trigger (c) the same way: only the roadmap-side A3.5 pass is
absent, since there is no roadmap candidate for it to run on — A0-O's
own A3.5 pass on any orphan candidates it finds still runs and can
still produce its own approval-needed bucket. Because
(a)/(b) require A1 to have found a roadmap and (c) requires it to have
found none, triggers (a)/(b)/(c) are mutually exclusive within one
Discover pass — so "at most once per pass" already held across all
three before trigger (d) below extends the same property to a fourth.

**Trigger (d)** closes a fourth gap, this one downstream of A1 but
upstream of A2. `idd-roadmap-audit.instructions.md`'s A1.5 (Audit
completed roadmaps) can itself stop before A2 for two human-input
outcomes — the roadmap-level blocked-by-human/needs-decision label
check, and the "Non-autonomous gaps found" outcome — and both stopped
unconditionally, with no `roadmap-first` fallback at all. Under
`roadmap-first`, when either fires, A1 has already found a roadmap (so
trigger (c) cannot fire) and A2 never runs (so triggers (a)/(b), which
both presuppose A2 ran, cannot fire either) — the whole Discover pass
simply stopped even when unrelated, claimable orphan issues existed in
the repository, the exact situation `roadmap-first` exists to avoid.
Trigger (d) fires strictly between A1 and A2 — after A1 finds a
roadmap, before A2 ever runs — which is disjoint by construction from
trigger (c) (A1 finds zero roadmaps) and from triggers (a)/(b) (both
presuppose A2 already ran): all four triggers remain mutually
exclusive within one Discover pass, and "at most once per pass"
continues to hold automatically. Trigger (d) is scoped to A1.5's
outcome reached via the normal A1 roadmap-selection path only — never
A0-T's own scoped A1.5 invocation, which already governs its own
outcome unconditionally and with no fallback. Preventive; no observed
incident yet — #3090 identified the gap by inspection of A1.5's two
stop outcomes against the triggers already defined here, not from a
reproduced session that actually hit the stop.

The `orphan-first` symmetric case — orphan candidates all failing A4,
which would fall back to the roadmap path — is a separate concern and
out of scope here.

### A3 — Diagnostic: all candidates blocked by an open roadmap

When the A3 decision tree reports zero ready-to-start candidates and
every candidate is blocked by an
`<!-- idd-skill-blocked-by: X -->` marker that points to an open
roadmap, the markers may be misused as grouping tags. Sub-tasks that
run while the roadmap is open belong in the task list
(`- [ ] #NNN`); the `blocked-by` marker is reserved for issues that
must wait for a separate roadmap to close first. Treat this pattern
as a likely authoring defect, not a real dependency stall.

### A4 Step 1.5 — Rationale: active-claim pre-scan

Active-claim pre-scans eliminate known collisions deterministically
and reduce wasted claim-post-recheck cycles, improving scale-out
efficiency when multiple sessions start simultaneously. Without the
pre-scan, parallel sessions all claim the lowest-numbered viable
candidate at the same second, then race the same-second tie-break;
the pre-scan moves the resolution earlier in the pipeline so most
sessions never touch the same issue.

### A4 Step 2 — Rationale: concurrent-selection desync

A4 Step 1.5 (active-claim pre-scan) and A5(e) (collision detection plus
same-second tie-break) only resolve a selection collision **reactively**:
a losing session has already posted its claim and snapshot, then re-enters
Discover and — because Step 2's tie-break is the fully deterministic
lowest-issue-number — **re-collides** on the next candidate. Observed in a
multi-session run as a 3-way race on one score-5 issue whose two losers
then re-collided on the next lowest number.

The opt-in `discover.selectionDesync: session-offset` knob adds a
**proactive** desync: within a single highest-score tie band it picks the
entry at `selectDesyncedIndex(session-token, band-size)` (a pure
`hash(session-token) mod band-size`) instead of always index 0, spreading
concurrent sessions across _different_ eligible issues up front.

`session-token` must be a per-session-unique value, never the bare,
session-shared `{agent-id}` alone: `idd-overview-core.instructions.md`
defines `{agent-id}` as shared across concurrent sessions of the same
agent type, with a unique session suffix only recommended, not required.
Sessions that follow that core definition literally and omit the suffix
all hash to the identical index and converge on the same issue — the
same converge-and-collide shape as the 3-way race above. This specific
bare-agent-id collapse is preventive; no observed incident yet — #1694
identified it by inspection of the two files' definitions, not from a
collision that already happened. `idd-discover.instructions.md` closes
the gap by requiring the session-suffixed `{agent-id}` or, when the
agent-id carries no unique component, a session-local fallback token
generated once at Discover entry and reused for the session — with
enough entropy
(random or UUID-derived) to stay distinct across sessions launched at
the same moment, since a bare timestamp alone would not.

It is off by default and reorders **only within** a same-score tie band so
the documented score-then-lowest-number ranking is the unchanged single-
session and fallback behavior. The load-bearing invariant is that the
branch name (`issue/<n>-<slug>`) derives from the issue, not selection
order, so spreading sessions across different issues never breaks the
same-issue branch convergence that A5(e) and the `branch-name` helper rely
on. The desync never crosses score bands and never bypasses the A4.5/A5
gates; the in-band offset function is replaceable without affecting these
invariants.

### A4 Step 2 — Rationale: milestone-scope preference

A GitHub milestone groups scope for a release (e.g. `v0.8.0`) purely as
human-facing material; Discover never read it before
kurone-kito/idd-skill#2340. A4 Step 2
already ranks by suitability score, then the optional concurrent-selection
desync, then the effort hint — none of which prefer the work a release is
actually waiting on, so concurrent autopilot sessions drain the backlog
issue-by-issue with no way to converge on a milestone's scope first. An
operator's only lever was re-explaining the priority to every session by
hand.

`discover.milestoneScope` (optional string; unset means off) closes that
gap the same way `selectionDesync` and the effort hint do: a **soft**,
same-score-band-only preference, never a gate. When set, a candidate whose
**OPEN** milestone title equals the configured value sorts ahead of other
candidates in the same suitability-score tie band, positioned after
selection-desync (session spread stays available even within a
milestone-preferred set) and before the effort hint (release intent
outranks size preference, but both still apply only inside one band).

The preference is symmetric-neutral by construction: an unset or empty
`discover.milestoneScope`, a candidate with no milestone, a **closed**
milestone, or a missing `milestone` field from the API all collapse to
the same "no preference" case, so a partial or stale read never
silently misroutes a candidate — it just falls through to the
pre-existing effort/issue-number order. Closed milestones are
deliberately excluded (not merely ranked lower) so a candidate never
keeps sorting ahead of its band after its release has already shipped.
`discover-roadmap-graph` and `discover-orphan-filter` surface the
resolved `milestone` title in their own outputs so the ranking input is
visible evidence, not a value an agent has to re-fetch to audit a pick.

### A4 — Scored-vs-unscored floor tie-breaker: what still ties afterward

Moved from the Discover phase file to keep the capped instruction
surface lean. After the scored-vs-unscored floor tie-breaker resolves
the mixed case, the remaining tie-breakers (concurrent-selection
desync, effort hint, lowest issue number) still apply in unchanged
relative order — for example, between two genuinely-scored candidates,
or between two unscored candidates when no genuinely-scored one is
present at that value.

## Claim resolution

### Forced-handoff strictness: strict resume vs. lenient relay-merge

Both the resume-routing read (`evaluateResumeClaimRouting` in
`resume-claim-routing.mts`) and the pre-merge write-gate
(`summarizeClaimValidation` in `protocol-helpers.mts`) resolve the active claim
through the **single** shared `resolveActiveClaim`, so there is no forked
claim-state logic. They deliberately pass **different** forced-handoff options,
and that difference is intentional policy, not drift:

- **Resume routing is strict.** It sets `requireAuthorMatchesForcedBy: true`
  (rule 7's author/`forcedBy` binding) and never passes `prFirstCommitAt`.
  Resume is a _takeover_ decision, so it must block the same-identity
  self-signed hijack and reject an issue-only handoff that targets a PR-backed
  claim.
- **The merge write-gate is lenient.** It leaves `requireAuthorMatchesForcedBy`
  at its off default and passes `prFirstCommitAt`, applying the Part-B allowance
  (kurone-kito/idd-skill#1058, an issue-only handoff predating the PR). The
  merge gate re-validates an _already-verified_ session and must tolerate a
  maintainer-authorized handoff relayed by a separate automation actor;
  authorization then rests on `isAuthorizedForcedHandoff` alone.

Because the two callers apply different strictness, they can return **different
verdicts for the same corrected-handoff state** — resume may report
`already_owned` while the merge gate reports `claimLost`. This is expected: the
verdicts answer different questions (may I take over? vs. does this verified
session still own the write?).

The split is kept intentionally (see kurone-kito/idd-skill#1155): the structural
risk the adopter raised — two divergent resolvers — is already removed by the
shared `resolveActiveClaim`, and forcing both sides strict would break the
legitimate relay use-case. Any future change here must preserve the single
resolver (do not fork `resolveActiveClaim`) and the resume-side
self-signed-hijack block.

### Activation-nonce: why a separate marker, and what stays deferred

kurone-kito/idd-skill#1480 found a verified near-miss: two independent
sessions can both adopt-verbatim the identical forced-handoff sticky
successor pair and both pass every `claim-id`-based check identically,
because nothing is posted at adopt-verbatim time to distinguish "the
session that legitimately adopted this pair" from "a second session that
also adopted it." kurone-kito/idd-skill#1522 closes that gap with a
standalone `activation-nonce` marker (`idd-claim.instructions.md`)
rather than a new field on `claimed-by`: adopt-verbatim posts no
`claimed-by` at all, so a field living inside `claimed-by`'s body could
never appear on the one path that motivates the mechanism. The winner rule
— lexicographically earliest `{nonce}` among however many trusted markers
exist for a `{claim-id}` — is a pure function of the observed nonce set
(mirroring the existing `{claim-id}` same-second tie-break), so two
colliding sessions compute the identical winner independently, with no
"both back off" livelock.

**Scope for #1522**: the issue's acceptance criteria name the **Claim
revalidation gate** (`idd-overview-core.instructions.md`) as the enforcement
point, and that gate is fully wired: it fires before any mutating step for a
live session holding its own posted nonce, and — since adopt-verbatim posts
no `claimed-by` and so never enters _Claim verification_ at all — the
adopt-verbatim paragraph in `idd-claim.instructions.md` carries its own
inline verify-then-compare instruction, the one path #1480 actually
exercises. Beyond the AC's letter, `evaluateResumeClaimRouting`
(`resume-claim-routing.mts`) also accepts `--claim-id`/`--nonce` and is
unit-tested, anticipating Resume Step 1 wiring — but the documented Resume
Step 1 invocation (`idd-resume.instructions.md`) never threads either flag
through, and a resumed process has no local memory of which nonce was its
own to compare against in the first place. Cold recovery
(kurone-kito/idd-skill#1529) now fail-closes: a resume that holds no
local nonce treats 2+ trusted activation-nonce markers for the active
claim-id as `disputed`/`stop` rather than guessing an owner.
The merge write-gate half landed separately: `summarizeClaimValidation`
(`protocol-helpers.mts`) now shares the same `findActivationNonceWinner`
primitive via `pre-merge-readiness.mjs`'s `--nonce` flag
(kurone-kito/idd-skill#1528), closing the one AC-adjacent surface #1522
deliberately deferred. The instruction-level half landed separately too:
`idd-pre-merge.instructions.md`'s F2 now instructs the session to pass
its own locally-recorded activation-nonce as `--nonce` when invoking the
readiness collector (kurone-kito/idd-skill#1615), so the merge-time
write-gate's comparison is no longer a documented-but-unreachable
no-op.

### Wrong-branch commit recovery: cherry-pick, never force-push

kurone-kito/idd-skill#815 named the risk directly: parallel worktrees
let a `git switch` move a checkout out from under another run, so a
commit lands on the wrong branch — typically the primary worktree's
`main`, or another issue's branch. The Claim revalidation gate in
`idd-overview-core.instructions.md` keeps the mechanical steps to a
one-line pointer to stay inside its byte budget
(kurone-kito/idd-skill#1525); this page owns the full procedure.

Recover by **cherry-picking** the misplaced commit onto the correct
issue branch (in its own sibling worktree), then restoring the
contaminated branch:

- **Unpushed** contaminated branch (typically the primary worktree's
  `main`): `git reset --hard` it back to its upstream.
- **Already pushed or shared**: do **not** `git reset --hard` then
  force-push to erase the misplaced commit — that is the forbidden
  force-push. Instead `git revert` the misplaced change, or let the
  operator evacuate the branch.

Either way, preserve that branch's real history and move only the
misplaced commit. `scripts/idd-doctor.mjs` warns on the same
primary-worktree-HEAD symptom this gate catches at mutation time.

### Claim release has no compare-and-swap: deferred (2026-08-13)

While resolving kurone-kito/idd-skill#1985 (PR kurone-kito/idd-skill#1993's
"Operator-present release" recovery path), round 6 review found that the
claim-marker protocol has no atomic compare-and-swap for releasing a
claim: `idd-claim.instructions.md`'s Claim-state parsing rule 5 releases
a claim via `unclaimed-by` on an exact `{agent-id}`/`{claim-id}` match
alone, with no check on whether the releasing session's belief ("no
later claimant activity") is still true at write time (preventive; no
observed incident yet). The maintainer accepted this as a documented,
bounded residual risk for kurone-kito/idd-skill#1985 specifically —
blast radius already limited
by the pre-existing claim revalidation gate, since a session that loses
its claim mid-window detects it on its own next required pre-mutation
check and stops, making this a detectable lost-claim event rather than
silent double-ownership. kurone-kito/idd-skill#2000 recorded the broader
protocol-level question that decision deliberately left open: should the
claim-marker protocol close this gap generally, beyond that one path?

**What "true CAS" would actually require.** Two GitHub-native mechanisms
give genuine atomic compare-and-swap, and both were considered and
rejected rather than being unavailable:

- **Non-force git ref updates** (e.g. `refs/idd/claims/issue-N`) — a ref
  update only succeeds as a fast-forward of its current value, which is
  real CAS with zero external infrastructure. Rejected because it
  abandons the append-only, human-readable, trusted-actor comment ledger
  the entire IDD claim/audit/trust model is built on.
- **GitHub Actions concurrency groups** — routing claim mutations through
  a per-issue-serialized dispatched workflow gives real mutual exclusion.
  Rejected on added latency, a hard dependency on Actions, and
  incompatibility with the `instructions-only` helper profile, which by
  design requires no workflow at all.

Neither is impossible — both trade away a load-bearing IDD design
property (portability, comment-ledger auditability, or
infrastructure-free operation) that this repository has consistently
protected elsewhere.

**What's actually achievable without new infrastructure.** The claim
protocol already has a self-healing, re-derivable consistency check for
the _take_ side: Claim-state parsing rule 4 re-evaluates whether a
superseded claim was genuinely stale **at the new comment's own
`created_at`**, from the live comment timeline — not from whatever the
superseding session believed when it decided to act. If a heartbeat
lands between a session's stale-check read and its takeover post,
replaying the timeline correctly invalidates the takeover. This is
optimistic concurrency with post-hoc detection, not true atomicity, but
it is genuinely self-healing. The _release_ side (rule 5) has no
equivalent: it is a bare identity match with no timeline-derived
liveness predicate. The parser-level fix would mirror rule 4's pattern
for releases — e.g. an `unclaimed-by` variant that embeds the timestamp
of the pause-evidence comment it is anchored to, honored only if no
trusted claimant activity has a `created_at` between that anchor and the
release event itself, re-derivable by any future parser exactly like
rule 4's staleness check already is. This would need a **new sibling
marker type** alongside the existing `unclaimed-by`, not a field added
to that same token: the existing token is parsed by a strict whole-body
anchor regex requiring exactly its current fields and nothing else, so
every existing (and every not-yet-upgraded) parser would read an
extended token as malformed and silently lose the release event. A new
sibling type keeps old parsers on today's accepted-risk behavior while
letting new parsers apply the stronger check.

**Coverage is inherently partial either way.** Even with the parser
extension, only comment-visible activity (heartbeats, comments, reviews)
is re-derivable from the timeline. The Operator-present release path's
own prose predicate also considers branch/PR movement, which a
comment-timeline parser cannot see. Rule 4's existing stale-clock has the
identical limitation today (only heartbeats refresh it, not pushes), so
this would be consistent with the existing design rather than a new gap
— but it means even the "real" fix would not fully close the class of
race the round-6 finding raised.

**Revisit triggers.** Reconsider this only if either becomes true:

- An **actually-observed** instance of this race class occurs (not a
  theoretical review finding) — i.e., a session genuinely loses work or
  produces confusing state because of a stale-read release, takeover, or
  forced-handoff decision.
- This repository's operating model shifts toward materially higher
  concurrent-session, multi-writer load on the same issues (today's
  desync/contention tooling — `discover.selectionDesync`,
  `discover-shared-file-overlap` — targets _different_-issue
  parallelism, not concurrent claim decisions on the _same_ issue).

**Candidate files (if ever pursued)**:

- `idd-template/.github/instructions/idd-claim.instructions.md` (Claim-state
  parsing rules, marker format)
- `idd-template/.github/instructions/idd-overview-core.instructions.md`
  (Claim format / Unclaim format sections)
- `idd-template/.github/instructions/idd-resume.instructions.md`
  (Operator-present release Step 2 — the actual writer of today's bare
  `unclaimed-by`; a guarded release marker needs this call site too, or
  the race it targets would remain unguarded here)
- `src/scripts/marker-helpers.mts` (marker regex/parsing)
- `src/scripts/protocol-helpers.mts` (marker classification)

Deliberately deferred, not `needs-decision`: there is no currently
blocking choice, since kurone-kito/idd-skill#1985 already resolved its
own narrower question. This record moved here from
kurone-kito/idd-skill#2000, which stayed open only as a findable record
until one of the revisit triggers above fires.

### Context-inheriting delegation residual risk

kurone-kito/idd-skill#2624 adopted a documented positive-framed
mitigation for the [Orchestrator delegation](../.github/instructions/idd-claim.instructions.md#orchestrator-delegation)
context-inheriting fallback: the delegation brief must state
explicitly that the delegate is the sole worker for the named issue,
with no peer workers to coordinate with or wait on. `#2624` itself was
scoped to the wake-up-discipline stall pattern and did not evaluate
this mitigation against a different, related failure mode: a
context-inheriting delegate mistaking itself for the orchestrator that
dispatched it, rather than the worker the brief names it as.

kurone-kito/idd-skill#2802 recorded direct field evidence that neither
that positive-framed mitigation, nor an added explicit negative
instruction naming the failure mode directly, reliably prevents it.
Three independent occurrences: a context-inheriting fork (sharing the
orchestrator's full transcript) whose brief opened with the documented
positive-framed statement nearly verbatim still produced a first-turn
status line functionally identical to the orchestrator's own
immediately-preceding turn-ending text — "I dispatched a worker and am
waiting for its completion notification" — despite there being no such
sub-worker, in two independent occurrences (each corrected mid-session
only by an explicit follow-up message naming the confusion directly).
A third occurrence, during the authoring pass that drafted `#2802`
itself (2026-09-09), added an explicit negative instruction ("you are
not an orchestrator, there is no sub-worker, YOU are the worker") to
the brief; the fork still ended its first turn describing having
"delegated to a background fork" and "waiting for a completion
notification," with zero tool calls made, and a second differently
worded attempt with the same negative framing reproduced the identical
zero-tool-call echo. Only abandoning delegation and performing the
work directly in the orchestrating session's own turns made forward
progress. After switching away from the context-inheriting mechanism
in the originally reported session, the failure mode did not recur
across roughly 13 further delegated dispatches in that session — a
small, uncontrolled sample, but consistent with a non-context-inheriting
mechanism addressing the failure at its root rather than through
better-worded briefs.

**Maintainer decision** (Groom hearing, 2026-09-10): adopt both
mitigations together rather than continuing to iterate on brief
wording the evidence shows does not reliably work. State the
non-context-inheriting delegation mechanism as a strong preference,
not merely a suggestion, whenever the calling tool offers one, and
record the context-inheriting fallback's residual role-misread risk
explicitly as a known, accepted limitation in both
`idd-claim.instructions.md` and `docs/idd-workflow.md`'s Orchestrator
fan-out variant section.

## Work and self-review

### B1 Step 3 — install-deps silent under-install detection

Two independent fresh-worktree sessions observed `pnpm install
--frozen-lockfile` report apparent success while silently leaving
`node_modules/.bin/tsc` missing (root cause unconfirmed; suspected pnpm
store/hardlink race). `scripts/verify-install-deps.mjs` is a thin
generic wrapper: run the configured install command, verify a key
binary exists, retry the install exactly once if it does not (including
when the install command itself fails), and fail loudly with an
actionable message if it is still missing after the retry. The existing
install-deps idempotency contract is preserved — the wrapper never
deletes or resets state, so reruns in fresh, reused, or recreated
worktrees still need no manual cleanup (#1237). It also validates the
resolved `pnpm --version` against the major pinned in `package.json`'s
`packageManager` field before running the install command at all,
replacing the fail-fast behavior `engines.pnpm` used to provide via
pnpm's own `engineStrict` — removed because `engineStrict` enforced
that field transitively against every downstream consumer installing
this package, not only this repository's own contributors (#3043; see
[docs/idd-helper-scripts.md's package-manager profile
note](idd-helper-scripts.md#helper-runtime-profiles)).

### WorkTrunk cwd caveat

An adopter session, using WorkTrunk's automation-safe invocation (`wt
switch --create ... -x true`), observed a `Cannot change directory —
shell integration installed but not active` diagnostic that did not fail
the command. From that point onward, the agent harness's own tool output
repeatedly reported the shell's working directory as reverted to the primary
worktree root, even immediately after a command that had run correctly in the
sibling worktree. Attribution between the harness's own working-directory
tracking and WorkTrunk's shell-integration hook could not be isolated (no
control-group session was available), so this stays a documented structural
gap in B1's guidance, not a claim against either component: the one-time B1
self-check gives no signal to keep re-verifying the working directory after
this diagnostic appears, even though the "working directory persists between
commands" assumption can silently stop holding from that point on (#2332).

**What to do**: once this diagnostic appears, treat the working directory
as unverified for every later command in the session — confirm it (e.g.
`pwd`) before trusting a command that depends on the current directory,
rather than assuming it still matches the last-known worktree.

### B1 self-check — Grok Build file tools bound to launch workspace

A Grok Build session's file-read and file-edit tools resolve relative
paths against the session's launch workspace — the primary clone,
whose HEAD B1 keeps on `main` — not the shell's current directory, so
a `cd` into the sibling worktree does not rebind them. Reproduced by
creating a sibling worktree, writing a unique marker only into that
worktree's uncommitted `README.md`, then running Grok's
workspace-default grep for the marker: it found nothing, while the
same grep given the sibling's absolute path found it immediately. A
shell `cd` into the sibling and a `pwd` reporting the sibling path
both looked like a passing B1 self-check throughout (#2819,
2026-09-10).

This is a different failure class from #2114's off-convention
worktree-creation primitives (`grok --worktree`, `isolation:
worktree`, `x.ai/git/worktree/*`): there, B1 creates the wrong
worktree altogether; here the worktree is correct and only the file
tools' workspace binding stays stale. It sits alongside #2332's
WorkTrunk cwd-tracking caveat above as another way a harness's own
working-directory signal can drift from what B1's self-check actually
verifies.

**What to do**: for a harness whose file-read/edit tools stay bound to
the launch workspace, pass every such tool call the sibling worktree's
absolute path instead of relying on a shell `cd`; a shell `pwd`
reporting the sibling path is not evidence those tools moved with it.

### C1/B2 critique pass — Grok `spawn_subagent` needs a bounded fallback

Grok Build's critique-pass row, unlike Codex CLI's, had no fallback
when `spawn_subagent` is unavailable, unsuitable, or fails — Grok
_has_ `spawn_subagent`, so a successful-but-unbounded pass never fell
back to a structured self-critique. In the Grok Build IDD loop that
shipped PR #2814 for issue #2774 (observed 2026-09-09, #2814): B2 plan
critique ran 387 s across 43 tool calls, C1 diff critique ran 575 s
across 40 tool calls, and a C1 re-critique whose brief named two files
plus
`git diff origin/main...HEAD` and said "keep this short" still ran
172 s across 25 tool calls and opened extra search rather than staying
on the named slice. The findings were usable, but one docs-only issue
spent roughly 19 minutes in critique subagents; Claude Code's `Agent`
path for the same C1 role is typically a short bounded review, while
Grok's general-purpose subagent treated the checklist as an
open-ended explore (#2825).

This is a different Grok gap from #2819's file tools bound to the
launch workspace (above) and closed #2114's worktree-creation
primitives: those are B1 worktree/tool-cwd; this is the C1/B2
critique _mechanism_ row.

**What to do**: give Grok's critique row the same fallback class Codex
already has (structured self-critique when delegation is unavailable,
unsuitable, or fails) without inventing a wall-clock or tool-call cap,
and require the critique brief to name the files or diff under review
so an unsuitable pass is easier to distinguish from a thorough one.

### B2.1 — Premise verification (decision-transcription issues)

Field evidence showed a worker asked to transcribe a maintainer's
already-recorded decision into documentation, where the decision's own
rationale asserted a checkable fact about what a prior change shipped
that the shipped code's own comment contradicted. The worker held,
surfaced the primary-source evidence, and only continued after the
maintainer corrected the record via an addendum. Nothing in the shared
instructions prompted that judgment call, and a documentation-only PR
has no test suite to catch a silently transcribed false premise later
(#1390).

### B2.2 — Example field-name verification

Issue `#2806`'s own "Proposed change" section cited an illustrative
gate field, `claimValid: false`, that did not exist anywhere in
`schemas/pre-merge-readiness.schema.json` — the real fields are
`claim.matchesExpectedClaim` / `claim.claimLost`. B2.1 did not apply
because that issue was an ordinary bugfix issue, not
decision-transcription, and the fabricated field appeared in an
illustrative example, not a rationale claim, so nothing in the written
instructions caught it during that issue's own implementation, PR
`#2875`; a Codex review caught it instead, after the text had already
shipped once. A maintainer hearing recorded on issue `#2878` added
this narrow, adjacent check rather than broadening B2.1's own
condition.

### B3 — De-duplication refactor: check for behavior parity, not just body equivalence

Closes a real regression class hit during #1208's `gh-exec.mts`
consolidation: 10 of 22 call sites silently lost `execFileSync` stdio
isolation / timeout options that a local `runGh` wrapper had been
adding when the wrapper was collapsed into one shared function. It was
caught only by an ad hoc critique pass and a reviewer comment, not by
written implementation guidance (#1238).

### B–C — Follow-up discovery bypassed issue authoring

On 2026-08-24, issue #2231 recorded that B-phase workers discovering
separate follow-up work had no unconditional in-file route to the optional
issue-authoring companion and had been observed creating issues directly.
The B–C guard now routes that work through Stage 1 or preserves it in a
durable issue comment when the companion is unavailable
(kurone-kito/idd-skill#2231).

### Stage 1 — Shared hold ownership conflict

On 2026-08-24, issue #2231 also recorded that a shared authoring label did
not identify the session holding a follow-up target, leaving concurrent
passes able to race through reuse and body wiring. The per-target trusted
owner-marker protocol, visible-note JSON posting, persisted anchor identity,
fresh re-reads, and same-owner heartbeat renewal before edits close that
observed conflict path (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2231).

### Stage 1 — Non-atomic new-issue publication window

During the 2026-08-24 remediation of issue #2231, review verified a concrete
create-then-label race: a newly created follow-up could exist without the
authoring label between two separate mutations, allowing another Discover
pass to see it before the hold was applied. The atomic create-with-label
requirement, capability check, and stop-before-create fallback close that
publication window (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2231).

### Stage 2 — Set-level release rollback safety

The same remediation exposed a set-level rollback hazard: if an early label
removal closed its target generation before a later removal failed, the
restoration owner check could fail and leave that target visible to Discover.
Release markers are therefore provisional until every target, with the anchor
last, has been verified; release retries reuse the verified marker comment ID
instead of appending an indistinguishable duplicate. Anchor identity is
persisted in every owner marker, and every Stage 1 edit re-reads both the
target and the set anchor (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2231).

### B3 — Dependency drift vs. own diff: a typecheck/lint diagnostic

A `typecheck`/`lint` failure in a file the current diff never touched
can look like a bug in the diff itself, when it is really dependency
drift or a broken `main` baseline — the #1164/#1193 incident cost real
debugging time this way before the guidance below existed.

### B3 — Local test flakiness under concurrent load: hosted CI is authoritative

Field evidence from roughly eight to ten concurrent local worktree
sessions on one machine showed delegated workers hitting local test
timeouts on specs their diff never touched; every failure passed an
isolated re-run and the hosted CI run (a dedicated, non-shared runner)
stayed green each time. This was plain CPU/resource contention, but
each occurrence cost real investigation before a worker could conclude
"environmental, not my change" — and the pattern recurs more as
adopters scale out concurrent sessions (#1391). Hosted CI governs when
it disagrees with a local outcome for the same commit; that does not
waive the fix-validate / pre-push-validate requirements themselves.

### B3 — Edit the canonical source of a generated docs/instructions file, not its mirror

This repository generates several `docs/**.md` and
`.github/instructions/**.md` files from an `idd-template/` canonical
source via `sync-docs.mjs`. Editing the generated mirror directly is
silently discarded on the next `sync-docs.mjs --apply` run, since the
mirror and its canonical source are often byte-identical or
near-identical, giving no visual cue at a glance. Only a
`.github/instructions/**.instructions.md` mirror carries an
`idd-generated-from` banner at its top -- a `docs/**.md` mirror never
does, so checking for the banner alone misses exactly this file class.
Both real occurrences in this repository were `docs/**.md` files
(`docs/idd-helper-scripts.md` and `docs/policy-constants.md`, both
caught pre-commit via `git status` plus a manual
`audit/sync-manifest.json` lookup, never merged but each costing a
revert-and-redo cycle -- observed 2026-09-03, `#2548`), and a
structurally identical bug independently surfaced the same session
inside a brand-new `audit-docs.mjs` checker (observed 2026-09-03,
`#2477`): its file-attribution logic
initially cited the generated mirror in a drift finding instead of the
canonical source, for the same root cause. Checking
`audit/sync-manifest.json`'s `syncPairs` for a matching `target` entry
closes that gap and catches this before any work is lost.

### C1 — Search sibling code for the same defect shape before closing

A bug fix scoped to the single reported call site can leave the
identical defect shape unpatched elsewhere in the same file, or in an
independently-maintained sibling implementation of the same logic.
`#1471` fixed a stale-multi-instance-rollup defect in
`classifyCiChecks` (`protocol-helpers.mts`); a follow-up C1 pass on
that same PR separately found the identical shape in
`ci-wait-state.mts`'s independently-maintained equivalent, filed as
`#1478` -- outside the original issue's own acceptance criteria.
`#2475` (a shared, loop-wide `consumedDispositionIndexes` `Set` in
`matchTrustedAdvisoryStickyDispositions`, `protocol-helpers.mts`, that
let only the alphabetically-first named bot be credited when a single
disposition reply named several) repeated the pattern in the same
file: the reported bug and its initial fix covered only that one
function, and a separate critique pass -- run to verify the fix, not
to search for new work -- found the identical shape unpatched in a
second, structurally separate loop (the `#1018` notice carry-forward
path, the more common of the two code paths in practice). When a bug's
root cause is a reusable defect shape rather than a one-off typo,
search the rest of the containing file -- and any
independently-maintained sibling implementation of the same logic --
for the same shape before treating the fix, or a C1 critique of it, as
complete (observed 2026-09-03, `#2552`).

## PR submit

### D2 — Adding a new CI job: dispatch-first rollout

This repository's `copilot_code_review` ruleset re-reviews every push
to a PR branch, so Copilot/Codex review cost tracks push count roughly
1:1 regardless of which files or CI jobs a given push touches. A new
CI job whose target runner cannot be exercised locally compounds this:
each debugging attempt needs a real push-and-wait round trip, so every
unverified hypothesis about why the job fails costs a full review
cycle on top of the CI minutes spent. Landing the job
`workflow_dispatch`-first and validating it via manual dispatch runs
does not reduce that review cost by itself -- the review re-run is
driven by the push, not by the job's trigger wiring -- but it does
stop an unproven job from auto-running (and burning runner minutes,
and adding failure noise) on every unrelated push during the same pull
request's remaining lifetime. The one path that does avoid review cost
entirely is iterating a Windows-/macOS-targeted job on a branch with no
open PR yet: this repository's `copilot_code_review` ruleset only
reviews PR-associated pushes, so a push to a PR-less branch never
triggers a review at all -- this is why that non-PR shakeout pattern is
worth documenting as an option, scoped to CI-infrastructure-focused
work, even though it deviates from the normal early-PR-then-iterate
practice.

Observed 2026-09-10 on PR #2897 (issue #2892): three
independently-reasoned, unverified commits debugging a
native-Windows-only CI hang in a new `lint-windows` job each triggered
a fresh full Copilot and Codex review and left the job's own
regression test failing at a near-identical elapsed time each round --
direct evidence none of the three changed anything that mattered, and
each round could only be diagnosed by pushing and waiting on a real
run, since this repository's own IDD implementation sessions are
WSL/Linux-only and cannot exercise a `windows-latest` runner locally
(Refs #2892, non-blocking).

## Review triage

### Merge-main livelock under fast-moving `main`

Under heavy concurrent-session load, `main` can advance before one
{sync path → E1 → F1/F2} cycle finishes, re-triggering
`behind-no-conflict`; naive repetition livelocks, never reaching F3
while `main` keeps moving (observed 2026-07-22, PR #1612). The fix is
procedural, not structural: post the `review-watermark` as the last
action before F3's `idd-merge-execute.mjs --apply` on every pass, so
anything that happens after — a CI rerun settling, a new disposition
reply, another `main` advance — stales it and fails `--apply` closed
on `review-currency` rather than merging on data the retry has since
invalidated.

### Zero-Accepted-PATH-A advisory re-review gate

Without this gate, E8's zero-Accepted-PATH-A path would skip E14 (the
only step that requests a fresh primary-advisory-bot review) entirely,
so a PR whose Copilot findings were all Rejected in a given pass could
reach F2's advisory-convergence check with the bot never having
reviewed the resulting HEAD (#1442). The gate closes that gap by
running E14's Primary advisory bot procedure at the now-stable HEAD
whenever a durable marker records that the last non-empty snapshot at
the current HEAD zeroed out on a completed-review PATH B disposition
(condition (a)), before proceeding to F1.

Condition (b) — the current HEAD's eligibility for AW3-S's
settled-window (non-pending) entry — is a defense-in-depth backstop
for a narrower subset of cases: D4 and F2 each already consult AW3-S
independently for this same settled-window entry (#2726), but a
true-virgin empty snapshot (one that never satisfies condition (a) on
its own) otherwise never runs E14 through this gate specifically.
Condition (b) guarantees that path also reaches the stale-request
recovery cycle (and its route to `COPILOT_UNAVAILABLE`), rather than
depending solely on D4/F2 revisits eventually accumulating enough
AW3-S cycles on their own.

The gate's own state was originally tracked only in the current
session's in-memory recollection of its last E1-E3 pass ("this
episode"), with no durable, GitHub-visible record: a session that
crashed, restarted, or resumed after that pass had no way to
reconstruct whether the gate should have fired for the current HEAD.
This recurred, and was deferred, seven times across PR #3048's own
review cycle (issue #3031, merged 2026-09-16) before a Groom-hearing
decision (2026-09-17) scoped a narrow fix (#3064): a dedicated
`zero-accepted-path-a-gate` marker (see
`idd-review-triage.instructions.md`) now persists which condition
fired and the HEAD SHA it was evaluated against, read back on every
evaluation instead of relying on session-local memory; a marker
recorded against a HEAD SHA that no longer matches the PR's current
HEAD — for example, after a sync-path merge advances HEAD — is stale
and does not satisfy the gate for the new HEAD.

### An advisory bot's embedded-but-unthreaded findings: mirror the detection scope, not the gate scope

`#2197`'s live 30-day sweep (337 merged PRs, observed 2026-09-03) found
a `coderabbitai[bot]` review in the older "🧹 Nitpick comments" /
"⚠️ Outside diff range comments" collapsible-body format can carry a
specific, file/line-cited finding with **zero** corresponding threaded
review comment — e.g. PR
`#1897` review `4863787336` (zero threaded comments on that PR at
all) and PR `#1871` review `4860403155` (a Major finding, only
unrelated Copilot threads present). E1 Step 3's "Review bodies" rule
only pulls
a review into `ReviewItems_snapshot` when its state is
`CHANGES_REQUESTED`; every sampled review here was `COMMENTED`
(CodeRabbit's own state for a nitpick/outside-diff finding), so the
whole review body — not just the embedded finding — was invisible to
E1, and E4-E8 never Accepted or Rejected it (#2559).

This is CodeRabbit's analogue of Copilot's already-solved
`suppressedCount` gap (#1880, `advisory-convergence.mts`): a finding
that exists in a bot's review but has no GitHub thread of its own.
Unlike Copilot's, CodeRabbit is a non-gating PATH B advisory bot here
— the fix mirrors #1880's _detection pattern_ (parse the embedded
findings, compare against threaded-comment count) but not its
_gate-enforcement scope_: an uncovered finding becomes an ordinary
PATH B `ReviewItems_snapshot` entry, not a new merge-blocking check.

`extractCodeRabbitEmbeddedFindings` / `countUncoveredCodeRabbitEmbeddedFindings`
(`protocol-helpers.mts`) do the parsing: scoped section-by-section
(heading to next heading), then file-grouping by file-grouping, then
finding-header-line by finding-header-line — not a full HTML/Markdown
parser, since CodeRabbit's own nested `<details>` structure has no
documented grammar to parse against. One sharp edge found while
building the severity-word regex: `\bTrivial\b` never matches inside
`_Trivial_` (CodeRabbit wraps each metadata segment in markdown
italics) — regex `\b` treats `_` as a word character, so there is no
boundary between the closing `_` and the preceding letter. Dropping
the trailing `\b` (there is no real ambiguity risk in this
already-scoped metadata segment) fixed it.

Newer-format CodeRabbit reviews (`Actionable comments posted: N`,
individually threaded) carry neither collapsible-section heading, so
this parser naturally returns no findings for them — no separate
format-detection branch needed.

### E4/E5 round-count defer cutoff

E4/E5 scored each PATH A item Low/Medium/High with no ceiling on how
many review-fix loop rounds (E1-E15) a PR could cycle through while new
Low-severity findings kept arriving. `critiqueLoop.e10NoProgressHoldAfter`
only fires when the **same** Accepted finding recurs without progress
across consecutive E10 passes — its own "meaningful progress" carve-out
explicitly does not fire when each round surfaces a genuinely new
finding, since that is convergence, not stagnation, by its own
definition. A PR where successive rounds each raise a different, real
Low-severity finding (one advisory bot converges, then a second bot's
own first review arrives after the first bot's findings are fixed,
itself finding something new) triggered no existing guard while
extending indefinitely.

Live-observed cost evidence motivating `critiqueLoop.deferAfterRounds`
(issue #2863, dated 2026-09-10; checkable via `gh api
repos/kurone-kito/idd-skill/pulls/<n>/reviews`,
`user.login == copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`): Copilot
review-submission counts of 11-59 per PR were observed on issue #2018,
issue #2255, issue #2264, issue #2368, issue #2403, and issue #2840.
Each review-submission count tracks one full E1-E15 loop iteration,
since E14 requests a fresh review after every push, regardless of
reviewer state.

Repository-owner-confirmed scope (2026-09-10, before #2863 was
drafted): only Low-severity PATH A items are eligible for the deferral
disposition — Medium and High stay fully blocking, matching
`e10NoProgressHoldAfter`'s own precedent ("unresolved High/Medium
findings remain blockers until fixed or explicitly redirected by a
maintainer"). The default threshold (`15`) is an explicit starting
point the repository owner expects to tune once real usage data
exists, not a final calibration.

`Reject (defer)` reuses the existing `**Rejected**`-prefixed reply
format instead of introducing a new top-level disposition category:
`isDispositionComment` already parses "starts with `**Rejected**`," and
F2/F3 pair dispositions to advisory comments 1:1 by count — a new
category would require touching that parser and gate for no functional
gain, since a deferred item's terminal state (rejected, with a reason
and a linked follow-up) is identical in shape to an ordinary rejection.

#### Sequencing the deferred follow-up against its originating issue (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2877)

E6's follow-up-issue rule requires a `Refs #<originating-issue>` line
on the deferred-work follow-up, and `Refs` is deliberately non-blocking
everywhere else in this workflow (including `discover-roadmap-graph`'s
cycle exemption) so an ordinary citation never stalls Discover. That
general rule is wrong for this one follow-up shape specifically: the
deferred work cannot be meaningfully implemented before the PR/issue it
was deferred from actually lands, yet nothing stopped Discover from
picking up the follow-up immediately. Rather than changing `Refs`'s
general semantics, `discover-readiness-check.mts` adds a narrow,
marker-scoped rule: when a candidate's body carries the
`<!-- <marker-prefix>-authoring-defer-source: review-fix-loop-cutoff -->`
marker, its `Refs #<N>` reference is resolved the same way an ordinary
`Blocked by #<N>` line is — excluded from Discover while `#<N>` stays
open. An unmarked issue's `Refs` lines are completely unaffected.

#### 2026-09-15 recalibration to 12, using a month of real data (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2999)

By 2026-09-14, roughly a month of historical review-fix-loop data
existed to sample, even though the `15` default itself had only been
live for 4 days (2026-09-10 to 2026-09-14) of that month — the
analysis below draws on historical loop lengths recorded under
whatever cutoff was active at each sampled PR's own time, not on `15`'s
own accumulated track record; a smaller, dedicated post-rollout
subsample (merged PRs since 2026-09-10) is examined separately below
for that narrower, apples-to-apples comparison — see that subsection
for its corrected size and figures; an earlier draft of this
introduction cited a stale, since-corrected count here. Pulling the 400
most recently merged PRs in this repository (`gh api graphql`,
`repo:kurone-kito/idd-skill is:pr is:merged`, counting `reviews` nodes
with `author.login == "copilot-pull-request-reviewer"` per PR — the
same counting method the entry above already cites) over a `mergedAt`
range of 2026-08-17 to 2026-09-14 (roughly 28 days) gave an initial
full-sample (n=400) distribution of min=0, p25=1, median=2, p75=4,
p90=7, p95=9, p99=17, max=22, mean=3.42, with only 1 PR (0.25%)
reaching 20 or more rounds and none reaching 25 or more.

**Correction (2026-09-15, same-day PR review, `chatgpt-codex-connector`):**
a reviewer on this recalibration's own pull request found that a PR
inside the sampled window with 59 Copilot reviews makes the
above-reported max of 22 impossible, and asked for the sampling
methodology to be reconciled before relying on it for calibration.
Independently re-running the count with full result-set pagination
(the initial pass, like this same mistake made once directly against
this recalibration's own draft text, silently truncated any PR with
more than 100 total review-timeline entries — precisely the highest
outlier PRs) against the identical 400-PR sample gives a corrected
distribution of min=0, p25=1, median=2, p75=4, p90=7, p95=9, **p99=21,
max=59** (`#2264`), mean=3.63. Threshold coverage: 35 PRs (8.75%)
reached 8 or more rounds, 17 (4.25%) reached 10 or more, 9 (2.25%)
reached 12 or more, 7 (1.75%) reached 15 or more, 5 (1.25%) reached 20
or more, and 3 (0.75%) reached 25 or more (the same 3 also reach 30 or
more). Every percentile from p25 through p95, and the 9-PR (2.25%)
count at the `12`-round threshold this recalibration actually turns
on, are **unchanged** by the correction — only the tail beyond p95 (p99
and max) and the coarser high-end threshold buckets (≥20/≥25/≥30) were
affected, consistent with an undercount that only silently truncates
the small number of PRs busy enough to exceed 100 total review-timeline
entries.

Of the six PRs originally cited for the stale `15` default, five merged
inside this 400-PR window — issue `#2255`, issue `#2264`, issue
`#2368`, issue `#2403`, and issue `#2840`; only issue `#2018` (merged
2026-08-15) predates it — and their corrected, fully-paginated Copilot
review-submission counts are 21, 59, 11, 11, and 32 respectively,
spanning nearly the full original 11-59 citation range. Issue `#2264`'s
59 is in fact this sample's new corrected max. This specific tension —
between the 2026-09-10 rationale's 11-59 citation and this
recalibration's own first-draft sample, which had wrongly reported a
max of only 22 — traces entirely to the pagination undercount corrected
above, and is resolved by that correction: it was a bug in this
recalibration's own data collection, not a genuinely different or
unreconcilable counting methodology between the two entries. This is a
narrower claim than "the review-fix-loop measurement approach itself
has no open questions" — see the two caveats below, which this
correction does not resolve.

Splitting the sample by merge date (older half 2026-08-17 to
2026-09-03, n=185, versus newer half 2026-09-03 to 2026-09-14, n=215)
showed a clear rising trend consistent with this repository's rising
IDD concurrency and throughput over the same period: mean 3.15 to
4.04 (+28%), p90 5 to 8 (+60%), p95 8 to 10 — matching, not correcting,
this recalibration's originally-reported newer-half p95 of 10. An
earlier draft of this note mis-reported the newer-half p95 as 9 using
a non-standard percentile rounding rule inconsistent with the
nearest-rank method used everywhere else in this analysis; a PR review
correctly pointed out that full-pagination correction can only raise
individual PR counts, never lower them, so a corrected percentile
computed the same way as before can never _decrease_ — recomputing
with the same nearest-rank method used throughout gives 10, unchanged.

**Second correction (2026-09-15, later same-day PR review,
`chatgpt-codex-connector`):** the "68 PRs merged since the `15`
default went live (2026-09-10 onward)" cohort below used a coarse
midnight UTC boundary rather than the actual rollout instant. The `15`
default's own PR (kurone-kito/idd-skill#2867) merged at
2026-09-10T09:20:17Z — 13 PRs credited to the post-rollout cohort
actually merged earlier that same UTC day, before the rollout,
including `#2840` (merged 2026-09-10T08:25:14Z, roughly 55 minutes
before rollout) at 32 rounds. Re-filtering by the actual rollout
timestamp gives a corrected post-rollout cohort of n=55 (not 68), with
mean=5.4 (not 5.56), p90=10 (unchanged), and max=35 (`#2895`, unchanged
— `#2895` merged after rollout either way); the four highest correctly
in-cohort PRs are 35, 23, 17, and 14 rounds (`#2895`, `#2855`, `#2868`,
`#2928`), not 35/32/23/17 as this note previously (still incorrectly)
reported. No visible censoring at 15 either way, most plausibly because
those specific high-round PRs' recurring findings were Medium/High-
severity (exempt from deferral by design) rather than any compliance
gap in the mechanism itself. Spot-checking the highest-count PRs found
no bot/vendor-bump/mass-rename noise skewing the sample: every one is
genuine human-authored feature/fix work, including some small-diff PRs
with disproportionately high round counts from protracted
back-and-forth rather than diff size. This cohort still only
coarsely approximates behavior specifically under the `15` default: a
PR merging after rollout can still carry review activity that started
before it, so PR-merge-time filtering alone does not isolate reviews
actually conducted under `15` — a further, disclosed limitation this
recalibration does not attempt to resolve (see the caveats below).

Twelve sits just above both the full-month p95 (9) and the
most-recent-half p95 (10) — a modest, data-grounded tightening in
response to the observed rising trend, while still exempting roughly
97-98% of ordinary review-fix loops (only 9 of the 400 sampled PRs
cross it, unchanged by either correction above) from the deferral path.
This replaces the original value's stale, cherry-picked justification
(six outlier PRs, not a representative sample) with one derived from a
full representative month, without swinging to an aggressive cutoff
that would defer a meaningfully larger share of ordinary loops. See
kurone-kito/idd-skill#2999 for the full methodology and the acceptance
criteria that applied it across every mirrored occurrence of this
default, and PR kurone-kito/idd-skill#3004's own review threads for
the pagination-undercount, percentile-method, and rollout-boundary
findings and these corrections.

**Open caveat, not resolved by this recalibration** (raised in the same
PR review, `chatgpt-codex-connector`): every figure above counts
Copilot review submissions per PR, the same proxy the original 2026-
09-10 rationale already used to justify `15`. The mechanism this
default actually gates is the same-claim `review-watermark` **post**
count (`idd-review-triage.instructions.md`'s round-count cutoff
section), which E1 refreshes once per snapshot and can refresh again
after disposition activity independently of a fresh Copilot
submission — so the two counters are not guaranteed to move 1:1, and
watermark-post counts could run higher than Copilot-review counts on a
PR with several disposition-driven refreshes in the same round. This
recalibration reuses the existing proxy symmetrically for both the old
and the new value rather than introducing a new one, so it does not, by
itself, make the cutoff's real-world firing rate any less well
understood than it already was under `15` — but a rigorous fix would
mean re-deriving this whole distribution against actual watermark-post
counts (parsing each sampled PR's comment history for the marker,
not just its review list), which is a substantially larger effort than
this issue's own scope of recalibrating an existing default using the
existing counting convention. Left as a candidate follow-up rather than
attempted here.

**Second open caveat** (also raised by `chatgpt-codex-connector`,
alongside the rollout-boundary correction above): filtering the
post-rollout cohort by each PR's own merge timestamp only approximates
"reviewed under the `15` default." A PR merging after rollout can
still carry review activity — including some of its Copilot
submissions — that started before rollout, so PR-merge-time filtering
does not cleanly isolate review activity conducted while `15` was
actually live. Precisely isolating that would require filtering by
each individual review's own submission timestamp rather than the
PR's merge timestamp, which this recalibration does not attempt; the
corrected 55-PR cohort above should be read as a closer, not exact,
approximation of behavior specifically under `15`.

**Third open caveat** (also `chatgpt-codex-connector`): every sample
above is `is:merged`, which excludes a PR whose review loop was still
open (or was closed without merging) at the 2026-09-14 sampling
cutoff — right-censoring that could, in principle, hide exactly the
long, non-converging loops this cutoff exists to control, so the
97-98%-exempt figure describes merged loops observed to completion,
not every loop this policy is exposed to. A same-day spot-check found
this repository had only 3 open PRs and 2 quickly-closed-without-
merging PRs (each open under a day, not long-running) at sampling
time, suggesting the current practical impact is small, but this does
not establish the concern is unfounded in general, and this
recalibration does not attempt to incorporate still-open loops into
the distribution. Left as a candidate follow-up, alongside the two
caveats above.

### review-ack worked example

A review posts a regular-comment finding plus a suppressed one.
Disposition the regular-comment finding normally (`**Rejected** —
verified placeholders-only`), then also post `review-ack:
claude-code-1a2b3c4d 4b825dc642cb6eb9a060e54bf8d69288fbee4904
2026-08-19T00:10:00Z` (plain text, no HTML comment) to cover the
suppressed one — the regular-comment rejection alone never sets
`converged`, and this is not a license to skip **AW6** or the fix flow
when the suppressed finding needs a code change.

## Advisory wait

### AW3-S vs AW3-R: why two recovery paths

`AW3-R` fires only once the pending Copilot request is already proven
to cover HEAD (`COPILOT_PENDING_COVERS_HEAD = true`) and just needs a
missing marker anchored. PR #1562 identified the opposite, unproven
case — a pending request whose association with current HEAD cannot
yet be confirmed — which `AW3-R`'s marker-only path cannot resolve,
since there is nothing yet to anchor. `#1571` adds `AW3-S`'s bounded
remove/re-request/verify/mark cycle for that case, deliberately capped
far below the ordinary `REQUEST_CAP` (30) by an independent per-HEAD
recovery-cycle budget (default 2), because each cycle mutates live
reviewer state (remove + re-request) rather than merely posting a
marker.

### Terminal Copilot stall-recovery contract: why a separate signal

`#1572` introduces `COPILOT_UNAVAILABLE` as a signal structurally
independent from every existing advisory-satisfied field, rather than
folding terminal unavailability into `outcome`/`f3Outcome` directly.
Keeping it independent means a future readiness rollup can consume it
without risking a silent, accidental widening of what already counts
as "advisory satisfied" — the terminal signal only ever unlocks a
maintainer waiver path, never merge readiness on its own. `AW3-S`'s
`"cap-exhausted"` classification deliberately does not by itself prove
`COPILOT_UNAVAILABLE`: a HEAD can exhaust its recovery-cycle budget
while the terminal window has not yet elapsed, or while a fresh
same-HEAD review has since landed — either fact alone would make an
immediate terminal declaration premature.

### Non-Copilot advisory convergence is intentionally not a merge gate

Issue #909 (2026-06-17) decided the Copilot advisory-wait / convergence
protocol stays **Copilot-only** in this repository's configuration,
where Copilot is the configured `advisoryWait.primaryBotLogin`; the
configured secondary, non-primary `advisoryBotLogins` (e.g.
`coderabbitai[bot]`, `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`) get no equivalent
merge-blocking required check. (A repository using the `external-bot`
profile to route `advisoryWait.primaryBotLogin` to a non-Copilot bot
instead would gate on that bot's convergence the same way — this
reaffirmation is scoped to the non-primary advisory bots, not to
"non-Copilot" as a fixed identity.) #899 recorded the deliberate
scope and its two-part
safety net: **pre-merge**, the E1 activity-universe snapshot plus
`review-watermark` delta catches a late finding before merge by
forcing a return to E1 when the F2/F3 pre-merge gate detects new
activity; **post-merge**, the #931 merged-PR unresolved-feedback
sweep (`scripts/merged-pr-feedback-sweep.mjs`) — a manually-invoked,
read-only detector whose output an operator feeds into fresh issue
authoring, not an automatic recovery path. It surfaces two kinds of
item: (1) a top-level regular comment or `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review
body with **no later** IDD disposition anywhere on the PR
(`collectUnaddressedComments` compares each item's timestamp against
a single global `latestDispositionAt` cutoff, not a per-item reply
check, so an item posted before the latest disposition counts as
"addressed" even when that disposition was for something else
entirely, including a disposition reply found inside a review thread —
the global cutoff folds those in even though `collectUnaddressedComments`'s
own output only ever lists top-level comments and review bodies, never
thread items); and (2) any review thread still **unresolved** at merge
time and not opened by an IDD agent itself, regardless of whether it
carries a disposition reply (`collectUnresolvedThreads` filters on
resolution state and origin-comment author, flagging
`dispositioned: true`/`false` either way). Symmetrically, the sweep
has **no backstop** for: a comment or review body with _any_ later
disposition, correct or not; a thread an IDD agent itself opened; or a
review thread that was **resolved** — whether with a correct
disposition, a false disposition, or no disposition reply at all.
Resolving a thread removes it from `collectUnresolvedThreads`
outright.

Issue #1352 re-opened the question after #1341/#1342 shipped
`idd-advisory-convergence` as a trusted-checkout required CI check for
the Copilot dimension, and after a 2026-07-13 weak-model structural
audit found a concrete non-Copilot fail-open: E6 can mis-classify a
CodeRabbit/Codex **non-review notice** (rate-limit, "usage limits
reached", queued) as a completed clean review, and E7's disposition
verifier validates the model's own self-report rather than live
GitHub — so an omitted or false disposition passes. Under
`fully_autonomous_merge`, that path can reach merge without a
GitHub-side block.

The maintainer **reaffirmed #909** on #1352 (2026-07-14): the
operational objections are unchanged and still outweigh a hard gate —
non-Copilot bots are capricious (a run may post nothing at all, and
CodeRabbit's first post is often a PR summary rather than actionable
findings), re-review is mention-only with no clean per-HEAD completion
signal, and pinging a bot risks waking a lenient reviewer mid-merge.
The E6 mis-classification and E7 self-attested-disposition path are
therefore recorded as an **accepted risk** under
`fully_autonomous_merge`, not a defect — the pre-merge snapshot net
still catches a late-arriving finding before merge, but a false
disposition it already produced has no #931 sweep backstop (see
above), same as #909 originally decided to accept. A future
weak-model audit that re-discovers this fail-open should treat it as
a decided trade-off — see #909, #899, #931, #1352 — rather than
re-filing it.

## CI

### 404-vs-403 ambiguity on branch-protection/ruleset reads

None of the three required-check-discovery endpoints (branch
protection, ruleset list, ruleset detail) documents `403` as a possible
response at all: the branch-protection reference lists only
`200`/`404`
(<https://docs.github.com/en/rest/branches/branch-protection#get-branch-protection>),
and the ruleset-list/ruleset-detail references list only
`200`/`404`/`500`
(<https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules#get-all-repository-rulesets>,
<https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/rules#get-a-repository-ruleset>).
GitHub's own REST troubleshooting guide documents this as general API
behavior: a `404` on a private resource substitutes for `403` to avoid
confirming the resource's existence, and insufficient token scope is a
listed cause of a `404` on a resource that actually exists
(<https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/troubleshooting-the-rest-api#404-not-found-for-an-existing-resource>).
Because these endpoints never document `403`, a `404` on any of them
is structurally ambiguous between "genuinely nothing configured" and
"the token cannot read this" — the response body cannot resolve that
ambiguity, and an actor's collaborator role cannot either (role is not
proof the caller's own token carries the scope the endpoint requires).
kurone-kito/idd-skill#1377 is why
`idd-ci.instructions.md`'s Required-check discovery step 4 treats every
`404` on these reads exactly like a `403` unless the repository opts
out via `ciGate.trustEmptyProtectionReads: true`.

### Rulesets-API write-side 404 for `gh`-CLI-default-OAuth-App tokens

kurone-kito/idd-skill#3080 (2026-09-17) recorded a separate,
write-side finding from the read-side ambiguity documented above:
`PATCH /repos/{owner}/{repo}/rulesets/{id}` can 404 for a
`gh`-CLI-default-OAuth-App-authenticated token even with confirmed
`admin: true` permission and a successful `GET` on the identical
resource immediately before the `PATCH`. The classic
`PUT /repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/{branch}/protection` endpoint
remains a working fallback for the equivalent write with the same
token. This was observed specifically with the `gh` CLI's default
OAuth App token; whether a fine-grained PAT or a GitHub App
installation token behaves differently was not tested, and is left as
an open question rather than asserted either way. idd-skill ships no
helper or documented procedure that writes a ruleset via the REST API
today, so this is a defensive documentation note rather than a
functional gap.

## Pre-merge

### The non-advisory pre-merge dimensions are model-attested, not GitHub-side enforced

F2's pre-merge condition check (`idd-pre-merge.instructions.md`) and
F3's merge-time re-verification (`idd-merge.instructions.md`) gate
claim ownership/freshness, late non-Copilot review currency,
non-Copilot unresolved threads, and `dispositionEvidence` completeness
through the `computePreMergeReadinessBlockers` rollup
(`scripts/protocol-helpers.mjs`) — called directly by
`scripts/idd-merge-execute.mjs`, and reproduced in the same
`{ ready, blockers }` shape by `scripts/pre-merge-readiness.mjs`'s
`buildPreMergeReadinessSummary`. Unreplied comments are a separate
case: `unrepliedComments` deliberately does not feed that deterministic
rollup, so this dimension is gated only by the written F2 checklist.
None of these dimensions has a dedicated GitHub-side required check
backing it — unlike the Copilot advisory-convergence dimension,
promoted to a trusted-checkout required check by #1341/#1342. (A repo
that separately turns on GitHub's branch-protection conversation-
resolution requirement gets GitHub-side enforcement for the
unresolved-threads dimension specifically, as a side effect of that
unrelated setting — see the conversation-resolution exception in
`idd-pre-merge.instructions.md` — but that is opt-in and not part of
this reaffirmed posture.)

The helper is explicitly allowed to be **discarded**: F2 states that
when helper execution fails, its output is invalid, or live GitHub
state disagrees with it, the session discards the helper output and
falls back to a direct live fetch plus the written prose rules. #1353
asked whether that posture should gain a session-aware GitHub-side
backstop, given a weak model can reach `gh pr merge` via the
self-attested prose path without the deterministic verdict actually
forcing the block.

The maintainer **reaffirmed** on #1353 (2026-07-14): the
helper-Preferred-plus-F2/F3-checklist posture stays the end state; no
session-aware required check is added. The "discard on
unavailable/invalid/conflict → prose fallback" clause is a deliberate
adopter-resilience valve (the helper runtime is optional per
`docs/idd-helper-scripts.md`, and a pure PR-level required check
cannot see a session's live `claim-id`/`agent-id` context the way the
model-run helper can). A full session-aware required check would also
fight the deliberate `pull_request`-only CI topology (#832 dropped
the redundant `push`-triggered runs; for this repository's own
PR-triggered runs, `lint`/`pnpm-boundary`/`idd-doctor` run against
GitHub's synthetic PR merge-ref checkout — not the literal PR head
SHA — and never independently re-check the actual merge commit that
lands on `main`; `pnpm-boundary` also keeps a `workflow_call` trigger
for downstream reusable-workflow callers, which runs against the
caller's own ref instead) and #993's existing F3 checklist
hardening.
Under `fully_autonomous_merge` this is an **accepted risk**; adopter
repos on `human_merge` retain a human as the backstop the autonomous
path lacks, and repos on `separate_merge_agent` substitute a second,
independently-invoked trusted session for that final gate instead of a
human (`docs/permissions.md`). A future weak-model audit that
re-discovers this fail-open should treat it as a decided trade-off —
see #832, #993, #1341, #1342, #1353 — rather than re-filing it.

## Instruction delivery

### Skill-based on-demand delivery of phase instructions: no-go (2026-07-16)

Issue #1416 investigated packaging IDD phase instructions
(`.github/instructions/idd-*.instructions.md`) as Claude-compatible
skill bundles (`SKILL.md` under `.claude/skills/` / `.opencode/skills/`),
on demand, motivated by issue #1413's OpenCode support track: OpenCode's
only conditional-loading mechanism is skills, unlike Copilot's `applyTo`
frontmatter. The full findings live in
`docs/skills-delivery-investigation.md`, which reaffirms and extends
`docs/claude-skill-strategy.md`'s prior Claude-Code-only no-go (which
evaluated wrapping the whole execution loop as a skill) to explicitly
cover OpenCode.

The decision: **no-go**, for either agent, under the current phase-file
boundaries. Once issue #1414 generalizes `AGENTS.md` into the shared
OpenCode/Codex CLI entry stub, OpenCode gains the same
routing-table-plus-on-demand-Read mechanism Claude Code already has, so
a skill wrapper would change only _how_ a phase file is requested, not
_whether_ it already loads on demand. More importantly, neither runtime
documents a "must load unconditionally" primitive for skills — every
invocation path is either an explicit model/user action or a subagent
preload, never a forced load at session start — so converting a
load-bearing phase file (e.g. `idd-claim.instructions.md`,
`idd-pre-merge.instructions.md`) into a skill would replace a
deterministic routing-table read with a probabilistic model judgment
call, weakening exactly the fail-closed guarantee the
overview-core claim-revalidation gate relies on those phase files being
read for. A third synchronized surface alongside `idd-template/` and the
generated `.github/instructions/` files would also multiply the drift
matrix for every phase-file edit.

Conditions that would revisit this: recorded evidence of routing-table
navigation failures on either agent at a material rate; either runtime
documenting a mandatory/required skill-invocation primitive; or explicit
adopter demand for skill-form delivery with a concrete use case the
routing table does not already serve. A future audit that re-discovers
this question (see issues #1413, #1414, and #1416) should treat it as a
decided trade-off rather than re-running the investigation.

### Microsoft APM as an additional distribution channel: no-go (2026-08-02)

Issue #1727 investigated whether this repository should distribute the
IDD template through [Microsoft APM](https://github.com/microsoft/apm)
(Agent Package Manager), a pre-1.0 MIT-licensed package manager for
agent context, beside the existing `idd-template/ONBOARDING.md`
raw-fetch-and-copy flow. The full findings live in
`docs/apm-distribution-strategy.md`.

The decision: **no-go** for the core template. Five payload classes
(`.github/workflows/idd-advisory-convergence.yml`, `.githooks/`,
`.github/idd/config.json`, `profiles/`, `idd-template/docs/**`) have no
APM primitive at all — APM's `hooks` primitive is a false-friend name
collision with `.githooks/`, since it covers harness-runtime
lifecycle callbacks, not git hooks. The phase-instruction corpus's real
activation key is workflow-step position, which does not map onto
APM's file-glob-scoped `applyTo` frontmatter; encoding it either way
degrades current behavior (a meaningless glob, or folding every phase
file into the always-loaded compiled context and blowing the
`instructionSizeBudgets`/`bundleBudgets` caps). APM's `apm.lock.yaml`
pins per-file content hashes, which is structurally incompatible with
the template's 26 `{{...}}` placeholder occurrences that onboarding
substitutes in place — every onboarded repository would carry
permanent, unresolvable drift from completion onward. Multi-target
compilation also breaks the corpus's own cross-references (bare-prose
mentions of `<name>.instructions.md`, the large majority of the
corpus's ~200 such references) on every non-Copilot target, since each
target compiles instructions to a different directory and, for several
targets, a different file extension. Net, adopting APM for the phase
corpus reproduces the "third synchronized surface" objection that
already decided the skill-delivery no-go above, now as a new external
CLI dependency rather than a same-repo generated file tree.

The one favorable exception: `skills/issue-authoring/` already
conforms to APM's skill-frontmatter contract, already uses the
`references/` convention, carries no placeholders, and its drift
arithmetic is net-neutral — APM's skill-bundle deployment would
plausibly **replace**, not add to, the existing
`skills/issue-authoring` → `.claude/skills/issue-authoring`
`mode: "exact"` sync pair. That exception is recorded as a named
revisit condition, not an adoption; APM's pre-1.0 release cadence (10
tagged releases in roughly 6.5 weeks as of this analysis) is an
independent, ongoing maintenance-risk factor even for that narrow case.

Conditions that would revisit this: APM reaching a stable schema; APM's
`instructions` primitive gaining a workflow-step-scoped activation mode;
explicit adopter demand with a concrete use case the raw-URL path does
not already serve; or a bounded pilot of `skills/issue-authoring/`
alone. A future audit that re-discovers this question (see #1727)
should treat it as a decided trade-off rather than re-running the
investigation.

## Documentation conventions

### Cite the observed incident

Issue #1596 adopted this convention after observing that
`mew-ton/soloscrum` cites a concrete incident for each entry in its
anti-pattern lists (for example, "Observed 2026-05-09 on issues 8 and
9" in that project's own tracker — not this repository's). A citation
raises the authority of a documented prohibition for
both humans and weak models — the rule reads as field evidence, not
authorial preference — and lets a later session check whether the
cited incident still motivates the rule.

When documentation or instruction text names an anti-pattern or
failure mode, cite the concrete incident that motivated it: a date
plus an issue or PR reference, when one exists. When no such incident
exists — the rule is preventive rather than a response to something
that already happened — say so explicitly, using the phrase
"preventive; no observed incident yet", so the absence of a citation
reads as a deliberate statement rather than an omission.

The convention applies **forward**, to new or edited passages only.
Retrofitting an existing passage with a citation is in scope on
budget-exempt `docs/` surfaces, but out of scope for
`.github/instructions/` files: do not edit an instruction file solely
to add a citation. That exemption is not retrofit-only — a brand-new
`.github/instructions/` passage that names an anti-pattern or failure
mode is exempt from the citation requirement too, for the same
reason: those bundle budgets already sit near their ceiling (see the
headroom review in #1525; scope clarified by #1647 after CodeRabbit
read the original wording as covering only retrofits).

When an instruction passage's motivating incident is worth recording
in full, put the date-plus-reference in a paired
`docs/idd-design-rationale.md` entry and link to it by section anchor,
as most cited passages already do. A bare issue-number aside directly
in the instruction text remains acceptable in place of that link when
no paired entry exists — both forms fit inside the tight
instruction-bundle budget that motivates the exemption; neither is
required.

### Trace a documented output field to its print/return call site, not a type or variable name

While drafting #2474's documentation of field-name variance across
this repository's evidence-collector helper scripts, an initial pass
made several confident, specific claims about which top-level JSON
keys a given helper actually returns. A fact-checking pass found that
roughly half of those claims were wrong — not because the underlying
behavior was misunderstood, but because a TypeScript **type name** or
an internal **local variable name** had been mistaken for an actual
printed/returned field. For example, `advisory-convergence.mts`'s
printed object was described as returning a `verdict` field: `verdict`
is only the local variable name holding the whole printed document
(the `AdvisoryConvergenceVerdict` type), never a key nested inside it.
`discover-viability-gate.mts` was described as returning a `passed`
field: `passed` exists only on an internal per-issue helper result and
is never copied into the printed top-level object. A second,
independent verification pass, re-tracing every claim to the file's
actual `JSON.stringify(...)` / `process.stdout.write(...)` call site
rather than to the nearest plausible-looking name, caught and
corrected every instance before the documentation merged (observed
2026-09-03, #2474).

When documenting what a script or function actually returns or
prints, trace every claimed field name to its literal
`JSON.stringify(...)` / `process.stdout.write(...)` / `return` call
site in the current source — never infer it from a type name, an
interface field, or a local variable name that merely looks like it
could be the same thing.
